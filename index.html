<h1>Join us in the journey of Digital Revolution</h1>
<p>Every parent dream of a successful future for their kids. What better could it be than to prepare their ward to be future ready and be able to face the challenges that appear in this digital world.</p>

<h1>Impact of digital revolution.</h1>
<p>Across the globe, the pace of digital transformation is accelerating. It is redefining traditional industry sectors and the way we live and work for eg. Few years ago, one had to go to a restaurant to eat the food of his choice, thanks to digital technologies now one can sit back on his couch and order his delicacies from the restaurant of his choice to be delivered at his doorstep that too in just a click away.</p>

<p>Until 1980’s there were hardly any televisions in every house, now each individual can watch his favourite shows in his convenient time in his place of choice. All these changes have taken place in a very short span of time. Looking at all these, one can definitely expect the future to be more advanced and challenging for the generations to come.</p>

<h1>What do researchers say about the need to cope up with this transformation?</h1>

<p>A new report by the World Economic Forum, Realizing Human Potential in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, highlights that the present education systems are failing our children by not preparing them for the workplace of the future.</p>

<p>Researchers believe that by the time children leave education, as many as two-thirds of them will not have the skills required to get a job. They suggest an alignment of training curricula with market demand skills which are both job-specific and generic, such as problem-solving and project management. In Finland, one of the world’s top-performing nations in education, the curriculum is updated regularly. In Ghana, the US and France, schools are pioneering short courses in coding based on peer-to-peer teaching, project-based learning and gamification.</p>

<p>With all these changes happening in the dynamic world, we at petals aim to improve digital literacy, critical thinking, logical reasoning, decision making and create an awareness about the digital technologies around the children so that they are adaptable to the future work systems.</p>

<h1>What is PETALS?</h1>
<p>Petals is an educational institute connecting STEM based learning, enabling kids to be future ready.</p>
<p>STEM is an acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. It couples academic learnings with real life projects/demonstration. It lays a foundation enhancing creativity, critical thinking, logical reasoning, Decision Making and Problem Solving Skills.</p>

<h1>What we offer at Petals?</h1>
<p>Petals offers a wide range of courses that helps kids to apply science and maths concepts learnt in school to real life technologies. By this children can appreciate and understand the value of basic science, maths in the real world. This inturn creates a curiosity and an interest to learn these subjects in schools and colleges. The child gets familiarized with the way of communicating with computers and understands how the computer works. This acts as a good base for learning advanced computer languages. Hands on training in basic electronics is provided in a safe manner which helps them to understand concepts used in daily use gadgets eg. working of a car horn, principle of switch…. Ultimately the child can develop a strong conceptual foundation in science and maths that help him/her to face the new world challenges.</p>
